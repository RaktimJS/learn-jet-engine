# Learn Jet Engine

**Goal:** To create a knowledge hub where anyone can learn and share knowledge on how a jet engine works through clear diagrams, building simulation software, and 3D models.
This project starts from *zero knowledge* and grows step by step into a structured, open-source learning resource.
